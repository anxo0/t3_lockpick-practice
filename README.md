# 🧰 Lockpick Practice (t3_lockpick)

This release contains a web version of the lockpicking minigame from the original [**T3development**](https://github.com/T3development) script.  
It allows players to **practice the lockpicking system outside of FiveM**, directly in the browser via **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Uses the **visual interface** of the original minigame.  
- No FiveM or server connection required.  
- Perfect for **training reflexes and precision** before using the system in-game.

Based on the original work by [**T3development**](https://github.com/T3development).

## 🗝️ Lockpick Instructions

- Hold **D** to **tension the lock**.  
- While holding **D**, use the **mouse** to move the pins and align them.  
- Release **D** if you need to reset the tension or try again.  
- Tip: keep tension steady and move the pins **smoothly** to avoid breaking them.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project **does not include any FiveM logic or server files**.  
It only extracts and adapts the **visual part for practice and learning purposes**.  
All credit for the original script goes to [**T3development**](https://github.com/T3development).
